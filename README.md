Black-Scholes is an implementation of the Black-Scholes Merton equation for price options calls and puts data. The first part gets options data from Yahoo Finance and uses the equation on live price data with live interest rates and dates. The five-risk Greeks were also implemented for calls and puts. The second part uses Monte Carlo simulation and the binomial tree method to price American option calls and puts, but with self-set parameters for the strike price, interest rates, etc.
